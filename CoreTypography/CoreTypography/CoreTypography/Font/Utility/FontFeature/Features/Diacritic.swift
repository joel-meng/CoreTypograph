/// The Diacritics feature type allows control over how diacritics (i.e. accent marks or applied vowels) appear in text.
///
/// - show: This is the default. It means to display the diacritics normally (that is, attached to their baseforms in the right place).
/// - hide: Don't show the diacritics. This is useful in Arabic children's book text,
/// where the same text can be shown with vowels for one reading audience and without vowels for another.
/// - decompose: Show the diacritics, but rather than attaching them to their baseforms, show them inline with the rest of the text.
